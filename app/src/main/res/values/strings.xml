    <string name="wstep_naglowek">About the dictionary</string>
    <string name="wstep_opis">Description</string>
    <string name="wstep_tresc">The Oasis Dictionary has been compiled along with the work on translating the Light-Life Movement\'s materials into English. The translations provided are well-conceived and have been consulted with theologians and native speakers of English. In particular, the terms directly related to our formative path should be considered official. It means one should not invent any other English counterparts of Polish words. \nOur dictionary contains so-called "Oasis" terms, both theological and practical. However, it is not a dictionary that replaces existing Polish-English dictionaries, nor does it contain all possible theological terms. These should be looked up in dictionaries, as well as in the Bible and Church documents. However, if you think a word or phrase that has not been included should be added, do not hesitate to contact us at A.Jankowiak(at)oaza.pl</string>

    <string name="pomysl_naglowek">Why an app?</string>
    <string name="pomysl_opis">Idea</string>
    <string name="pomysl_tresc">There is not always time to reach for the paper version of the dictionary (particularly during a retreat in a faraway country). Moreover, searching for a single phrase over several pages of text takes time. In such moments, the application comes to the rescue and allows us to find the word we need immediately. \nWe hope that the app will prove helpful during various endeavors. \nWe will also be grateful for any suggestions, comments, and ideas for developing this project.</string>
